# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications. The problem arises when the application fails to correctly parse the incoming JSON data, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description

The Express.js application is designed to receive JSON data via a POST request to the '/data' endpoint.  However, when a JSON payload is sent, `req.body` remains empty.  This is a common issue if the correct middleware isn't set up for parsing JSON request bodies.  The server starts without error, but the POST request processing fails silently.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON request bodies.  This middleware should be placed before any route handlers that expect JSON data.
